- Follow modular architecture and clean code.
- Implement structured logging with context.
- Use commit best practices: atomic commits with clear messages.
- Run all commands from the project's **virtual environment**.
- Exclude `.venv/`, doc builds, build artifacts.
- Pin dependencies in `requirements.txt` or `Pipfile.lock`.
- Include `pyproject.toml` or `setup.cfg` for centralized tool config.
- Use linters (flake8/ruff), formatters (Black), and import sorting (isort) with pre-commit hooks. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
